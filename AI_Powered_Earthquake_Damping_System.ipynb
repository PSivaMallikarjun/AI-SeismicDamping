        "## **5. Implementation Plan**  \n",
        "The project will be executed in multiple phases, starting with research and prototype development, followed by pilot deployment in controlled environments before full-scale implementation. Each phase includes testing, data analysis, and system optimization to ensure reliability and effectiveness.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **6. Real-Time Applications**  \n",
        "The AI-Powered Earthquake Damping System can be implemented in:  \n",

Its AI-driven approach enables adaptive learning, making the damping response more effective over time. By integrating real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, the system contributes to proactive disaster management strategies.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **8. Risk Assessment**  \n",
        "Potential risks include system failure due to power outages, sensor inaccuracies, and AI model limitations. These risks are mitigated through redundant power sources, advanced calibration techniques, and continuous AI model refinement using real-world data.  \n",
